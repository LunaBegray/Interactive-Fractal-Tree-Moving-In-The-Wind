# Interactive-Fractal-Tree-Moving-In-The-Wind

A mesmerizing fractal tree visualization built with Python's `turtle` module and `tkinter` for real-time interactivity.

### Features
- **Dynamic Animation**: Watch the fractal tree grow and sway with wind simulation.
- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust the tree's angle, depth, and wind speed using sliders.
- **Fast Rendering**: Optimized for smooth visuals.

### Installation
1. Install Python (>=3.7).
2. Ensure `tkinter` is included (comes with standard Python installation).

### Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python fractal_tree.py
   ```
2. Use the sliders to adjust:
   - **Angle**: Controls the branching angles.
   - **Depth**: Sets the recursion level (complexity).
   - **Wind Speed**: Alters the sway of branches.
